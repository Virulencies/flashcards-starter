# FlashCards Starter Kit

## Welcome to my Mod 2 Flash Card Game! 
Test your knowledge of iterator methods and their applications! All you'll need to get started is a working terminal, and of course access to this repo.


## Setup

Clone down this repo with your terminal. One cloned, navigate into the flashcards directory and run npm install. Thats it!

## To Play
After everything is installed, run node index.js to start up the game. You can either type the number of the answer to the question, or use your arrow keys to navigate up and down. Once an answer is entered or selected, press the return/enter key to recieve feedback and proceed to the next question. There are 30 questions, and a score will be provided at the end of the game. Have fun!
